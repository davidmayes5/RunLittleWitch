This was a game I developed for a project in Dr. Jennifer Park's English 146 class. Oh, what a joy it is to be able to program for English! Feel free to enjoy and distribute the game* as much as you want. I do request that you not remove the art used for the title screen or the music and distribute either separately from the game*. Those are works created by my brothers who were very gracious in letting me include them in my game. Thanks, Ian and Jonathan!

Unfortunately, Run Little Witch is only available for Windows right now.  I have both Linux and MacOS versions, but the file used to run them is too large for me to easily upload to GitHub at this point.  If you use Mac or Linux and you just CAN'T not play Run Little Witch, please contact me at damayes5@gmail.com!

But indeed that is it for now. Enjoy!
