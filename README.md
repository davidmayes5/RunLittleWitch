This was a game I developed for a project in Dr. Jennifer Park's English 146 class. Oh, what a joy it is to be able to program for English! Feel free to enjoy and distribute the game* as much as you want. I do request that you not remove the art used for the title screen or the music and distribute either separately from the game*. Those are works created by my brothers who were very gracious in letting me include them in my game. Thanks, Ian and Jonathan!

For any of you badass Linux users out there, I do have a version of the game for playing on Linux.  I didn't include it here because I didn't want it to clutter things if there was no demand for it.  If you use Linux and you just MUST play Run Little Witch, shoot me an email at damayes5@gmail.com and I can send you the file!

But indeed that is it for now. Enjoy!
